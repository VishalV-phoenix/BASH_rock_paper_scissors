A simple terminal-based **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game written in **Bash**.  
Play against the computer in an infinite loop until you choose to exit.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The user chooses `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.
- The computer randomly picks one of the three.
- The script compares both choices and declares a winner.
- The game repeats until the user chooses to quit.
